DataMining HomeWork
==========
#My data mining codeÔºÅWritten by python and matlab.

### If you are interested in this work, join me :).


## How to run
1. Install python3, pip3, virtualenv,in your system.
2. Clone the project `git clonehttps://github.com/maze1377/DataMining && cd DataMining`
3. Create a virtualenv named venv using `virtualenv -p python3 venv`
4. Connect to virtualenv using `source venv/bin/activate`
5. From the project folder, install packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Now environment is ready. Run it by `python {algorithms}/main.py`
### or
1. Install anaconda with all packages in your system.
2. Open anaconda prompt. 
3. Now environment is ready. Run it by `python {algorithms}/main.py`

#### More algorithms are being committing, thank you for your attention.  

Each algorithm, along with the additional hotspot description, is placed in a pdf file

# algorithms:

1-Covariance 

2-Mean Shift

3-effect distance on result of clustering (Sqeuclidean , Braycurtis , Canberra , Chebyshev , cityblock , correlation , cosine , euclidean , mahalanobis , seuclidean )

4-Predicting Diabetes Patient Readmission

5-RBF Space 

6-Gaussian Mixture Model 

7-K-Nearest Neighbors

8-Eigendecomposition of a matrix space

9-Correntropy Indicator

10-kmean  with pseudo huber distance
